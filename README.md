## Introduction

My analysis is centered around the question: Do recipes with 15 or more ingredients tend to have higher ratings? Answering this question is useful practically as it can suggest which recipes should be chosen when you are cooking. It can also provide a general idea of whether or not it is helpful to include more ingredients in a recipe.

This project makes use of two datasets from food.com, one containing recipes and the other containing reviews and ratings submitted for the recipes in the first dataset. These two datasets were then left merged into one larger dataset, which makes it easier to work with and to identify which ratings correspond to wihch recipes. This resulting dataset contains 234429 rows and 26 columns, and but only some of the columns are relevant to my analysis. These columns are:

- 1
- 2
- 3
